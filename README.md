# VIT Marketplace

Objective: The main goal of this website would be to provide a platform to connect the students of vit who want to either buy or sell their belongings.

## Workflow:

A student first needs to sign up and details such as: Name, prn, email.id, contact no. must be provided mandatorily and he/she can also provide some additional information about their social media handles.

## UI/UX:

The site can be primarily divided into 4 parts: Explore, Recent Activity, Adding a post, User Profile.

### The Explore Page

The Explore area will display all the random posts and there will be a search mechanism so that the user can look for their desired item.

### Structure of a post:

1. Images
2. Title
3. Description (which will contain info about the condition of the item)
4. Minimum cost
5. Interested button
6. The 'Interested' mechanism

If a user wants to buy a particular item then he can click on the interested button so a mail will be triggered and sent to the author of the post and it will also reflect in the recent activity section of the author that someone is interested in his post (the username of the person interested will also be displayed) so now the author will have two options either to accept or reject the request. If the author accepts the request then again a mail will be triggered and sent to the interested person listing all the contact details of the author, it will also reflect in the recent activity section of the interested person. The mail will contain the contact details of the author. The post will be closed after this. If the author rejects the req then the interested person will be informed through mail and the recent activity section.
Adding a post
Through this page a user can simply add a post about the item he needs to sell.
The profile page
Profile will basically contain all the info about the user and a functionality to edit his profile. Also, this page will display all the posts of the user.
